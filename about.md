### The LRG Project

An LRG is a manually curated record that contains stable and thus, un-versioned reference sequences designed specifically for reporting sequence variants with clinical implications.  
Each LRG contains a stable “**fixed**” section and a regularly updated “**updatable**” section:  

* The **fixed section** contains stable genomic DNA sequence for the region of interest, transcripts and proteins deemed essential for reporting variants, and an LRG-specific exon numbering system.  

* The **updatable section** contains the most recent biological information for each LRG region, including mapping information, annotation of all transcripts and overlapping genes in the region, and legacy exon and amino acid numbering systems.  

The sequences of each LRG are chosen in collaboration with research and diagnostic laboratories, LSDB (locus specific database) curators and mutation consortia with expertise in the region of interest. Additional information on collaborators can be found [here](/lrg-collaborators/).  

<br />
The creation of an LRG involves several steps:  

1. **LRG requested** - Collaborators (for example, LSDB curators, members of diagnostic and research communities and/or clinical experts from specific disease areas, etc.) can request an LRG, following the [guidelines](/lrg-request/).

2. **RefSeqs reviewed** and RefSeqGene released by NCBI

3. **Pending LRG created** created by NCBI and EBI

4. **Experts in LRG region of interest contacted** for input by EBI. For more on experts see [the LRG collaborators page](/lrg-collaborators/)

5. **Transcripts reviewed by LRG curators** at EBI. Publicly available data from RefSeqGene and Ensembl is scrutinized for each transcript in the LRG region. Only transcripts with good biological understanding and essential for reporting variants will be included. Changes can be made to a pending record at this stage, if necessary

6. **Final review** performed by LRG curators at EBI

7. **LRG published** and collaborators informed  


EBI and NCBI are committed to developing the technical solutions, as well as computational and visual tools to work with LRG sequences. This enables all the information reported on an LRG to be integrated with the human genome reference sequence.

### Contact

If you would like to give us feedback or request an LRG for your gene of interest, please email us at <a class="bold_font" href="mailto:contact@lrg-sequence.org">contact@lrg-sequence.org</a>.

### Past support

- [Gen2Phen](http://www.gen2phen.org/){: .icon-external-link} sponsored a meeting in 2008 with key stakeholders, including EMBL-EBI, NCBI, HGVS, LSDB curators and other members of the community. As a result, the Locus Reference Genomic (LRG) project was created founded on the RefSeqGene project.
