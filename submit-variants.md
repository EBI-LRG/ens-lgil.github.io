Consistent with the goals of the LRG collaboration, we offer the opportunity to submit information about variants to [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/) or [dbVar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar){: .icon-external-link}/[DGVa](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/){: .icon-external-link}, as appropriate, and obtain an accession number for each variant. The results will be returned to you as outlined in the [instructions](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex/docs/SubmittingVariationInfo.pdf).  
<br />


### Minimal information

The minimum information you need to report for each mutation is:

* The mutation description in **HGVS nomenclature**, preferably using a LRG record as reference sequence.  

* The **number of independent observations** (defaults to one).  

* Whether the mutation is **somatic**, **germline** or **unknown**.

<br />


### Recommanded information

We would encourage you to also submit the following information:

* The **type of phenotype ID** (OMIM, MeSH, UMLS, HPO or SNOMED)  

* **Phenotype ID** value  

* Clinical interpretation of the **level of pathogenicity** associated with this variant  

* **PubMed ID(s)**  

* **Local ID** - the identifier your organization uses to uniquely identify this variant  

* **OMIM** allelic variant ID  

* The **gender and ethnicity** of the individuals in which this variant was identified  

* A **URL** that points to this variant on your organization's website  

* **Alternate designations** or **common names** for this variant  

* The **assay method** that was used to identify this variant  

<br />

### Submission procedure

Below is a general outline of the submission procedure: 

1. **Download and read the [instructions](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex/docs/SubmittingVariationInfo.pdf)** for submission and the [submission template](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex/docs/submission_template.xls) so you understand the procedure and the steps involved.  

2. **Fill in** your submission data in the template.  

3. **Request a "handle"** from [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/handle){: .icon-external-link} and enter this in the submission template.  

4. **Email the submission** and "handle" to <a class="bold_font" href="mailto:submit-variants@lrg-sequence.org">submit-variants@lrg-sequence.org</a>  
   Alternatively, if the submission is large, request an upload account on our FTP server by sending an email to <a class="bold_font" href="mailto:submit-variants@lrg-sequence.org">submit-variants@lrg-sequence.org</a> and upload the submission via FTP.
