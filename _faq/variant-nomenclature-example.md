The COL1A1 gene is represented by LRG record [LRG_1](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex/LRG_1.xml) which has a single transcript (t1) and a single corresponding protein (p1).  
The frequently reported disease-causing variant **NG_007400.1:g.9595G>A** can also be reported as **NM_000088.3:c.769G>A**, and as **NP_000079.2:p.Gly257Arg** using the current RefSeqGene and RefSeq mRNA and protein reference sequences. Since LRGs contain the genomic DNA, mRNA and protein sequences within a single record, the three corresponding descriptions are **LRG_1:g.9595G>A**, **LRG_1t1:c.769G>A** and **LRG_1p1:p.Gly257Arg**.
