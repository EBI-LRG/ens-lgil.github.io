Each LRG contains a stable “fixed” section and a regularly updated “updatable” section.
The fixed section contains stable genomic DNA sequence for the region of interest, transcripts and proteins deemed essential for reporting variants, and an LRG-specific exon numbering system.
The updatable section contains mapping information, annotation of all transcripts and overlapping genes in the regions, and other relevant information submitted by the community (e.g legacy exon numbering).
