Each LRG contains a stable “fixed” section and a regularly updated “updatable” section.
The fixed section contains stable genomic DNA sequence for the region of interest, transcripts and proteins deemed essential for reporting variants, and an LRG-specific exon numbering system.
The updatable section contains mapping information, annotation of all transcripts and overlapping genes in the region, and legacy exon and amino acid numbering systems.
