RefSeq and RefSeqGene records will continue to be generated. When an LRG is established, the exact version of the RefSeqGene and its annotated RNA (NM_ or NR_) and protein (NP_) will be “frozen”, and cross references added to the LRG. For an example, see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LRG_1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LRG_1).
