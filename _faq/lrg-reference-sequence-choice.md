The sequences of each LRG are chosen in collaboration with research and diagnostic laboratories, LSDB (locus specific database) curators and mutation consortia with expertise in the region of interest. Reference sequences are suggested by the community and reviewed by LRG curators. Working with the community ensures that each LRG record contains the most appropriate reference sequences for reporting variants in that region.
