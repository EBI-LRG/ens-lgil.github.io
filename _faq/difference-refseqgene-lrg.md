LRG and RefSeqGene are collaborative resources. The advantages of using LRGs for variant reporting are:  
1. LRGs are specifically created for the reporting of clinically relevant variants and hence, are for loci with clinical implications.  
2. LRGs are stable and therefore are not versioned, thus reducing ambiguity when reporting variants.  
When an LRG is established for any gene, the RefSeqGene and its annotation will be “frozen” to match that of the LRG.
