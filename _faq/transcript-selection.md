During the LRG creation process, LRG curators will review the transcript submitted by the requester as well as all other transcripts in the region of interest for potential inclusion in the record. Curators will perform alignments and analyze publicly available expression data as part of this review process. Only transcripts for which there is currently good biological understanding *AND* are required for the unambiguous reporting of disease-causing variants will be included. When deemed necessary by experts in the community, LRG curators will consider using idealized transcripts as reporting standards, even if they are not supported with biological evidence.
