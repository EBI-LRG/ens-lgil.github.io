As the LRG consists of genomic, transcript and protein sequences that are linked, the sequence covering the introns are present too.  
Below are examples of using HGVS nomenclature to report a variant in an intron e.g.
**[rs750106647](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=rs750106647)** is **LRG_1t1:c.4005+11T>C** and **[rs778417218](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=rs778417218)** is **LRG_1t1:c.4005+5G>A**.
