It's inevitable that new transcripts of biological importance will be discovered for genes for which an LRG already exists. Such transcripts can be added to the updateable section of an LRG. New transcripts can only be added to the fixed section, if they are essential for reporting clinically relevant variants.  
A compelling case can be made for their inclusion if the new transcripts encode different proteins of clear clinical importance and variants cannot be meaningfully described in terms of the current transcripts in the LRG. Consideration of requests for the addition of new transcripts will be on a case-by-case basis.
