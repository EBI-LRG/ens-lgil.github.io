The LRG XML schema was created in [RELAX NG](http://relaxng.org) schema description language and can be downloaded from [http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex/LRG.rnc](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex/LRG.rnc). The schema has a date stamp and any changes would be accompanied by a change in the date.  
The current version of the schema is **Schema 1.9** and its documentation can be found on the [LRG FTP site](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex/docs/LRG_XML_schema_documentation_1_9.pdf).
