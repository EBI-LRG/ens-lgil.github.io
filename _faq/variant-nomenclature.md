No, the standard [HGVS Nomenclature](http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/) will still be used. [HGVS](http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/) and [EMQN](http://www.emqn.org/emqn/Home) best practice guidelines have endorsed LRGs.  
The stable identifiers of the genomic, transcript, and protein sequences in the fixed section of an LRG (transcripts: “t1”, “t2”, etc.; proteins: “p1”, “p2”, etc.) can be used for stable reporting of variants. See "Can you give me an example?" for more details.
