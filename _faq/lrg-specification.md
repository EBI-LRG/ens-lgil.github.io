The current version of the technical specification document is available at [http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex/docs/LRG.pdf](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex/docs/LRG.pdf).  
There is a version number and date stamp in the bottom margin to help in tracking changes to the specification.
