Copy number variation (CNV) will certainly be an issue, but LRGs are certainly no less well suited to the task of variant description than existing reference sequence records. Requests will be considered for the creation of an LRG representing a particular allele with respect to CNV and we will work with the requesting party to achieve the best practicable solution to represent the allele.
