Here is the list of external softwares supporting LRGs:  

* [Mutalyzer](http://www.mutalyzer.nl/)'s **"Name Checker"**, **"Syntax Checker"**, and **"Name Generator"** ensure that variants described using LRG sequences follow HGVS guidelines.  
* Alamut (from [Interactive Biosoftware](http://www.interactive-biosoftware.com/))
* [Variant Effect Predictor](http://www.ensembl.org/VEP) (from [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org))
* [Variobox](http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/software/variobox/) facilitate interpretation of variation data described using LRG coordinates.  

In addition,the LOVD DNA variation database system supports LRGs.
