Once an LRG has been made public, the transcript(s) included in the Fixed section of the record cannot be removed.  
This means that if the knowledge about an LRG transcript has changed significantly (i.e. changes to the position of the start ATG or changes to protein coding exons), it is not possible to note this information in the LRG record.
The only way to provide accurate information about an LRG transcript that has changed is to create a new record that includes the updated version of the transcript.  
If your favourite LRG has been superseded and you would like more information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@lrg-sequence.org">contact@lrg-sequence.org</a>.
