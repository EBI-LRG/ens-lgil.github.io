No changes to the sequences in an LRG will be permitted.  
If it's no longer possible to describe a sequence variant in terms of an existing LRG, it might be necessary to create a totally new LRG with a uniquely different number (e.g. LRG_1275 instead of the existing LRG_89). The original LRG will not be "retired" and it will remain valid to describe variants with respect to that sequence record. Creation of additional LRGs for an existing gene or genomic region will only be considered in the most exceptional circumstances.
