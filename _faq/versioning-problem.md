Versioning is an issue with traditional reference sequence records simply because the actual sequences differ from version to version for records with the same accession number.  
**The LRG sequence data for the genomic DNA, the transcripts and their translation products will never be changed**.  
Consequently, a variant description such as LRG_13:g.8290C>A will always remain valid and will never be subject to misinterpretation. The user simply needs to ensure that the LRG contains all of the necessary transcripts for the intended task.
