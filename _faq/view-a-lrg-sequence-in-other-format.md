Within the browser view of a LRG it is possible to display the individual sequences (genomic DNA, transcripts and their translated protein sequences) in FASTA format. This allows copying and pasting of sequences into other applications that support that format.  
From NCBI, try the “graphics” display [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LRG_1?report=graph](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LRG_1?report=graph).
