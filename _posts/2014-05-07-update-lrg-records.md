title: Update of LRG records
---

The updatable section of each LRG has now been regenerated to contain the most up-to-date information available from NCBI and Ensembl (Ensembl release 75, GRCh37 primary assembly) for the given LRG region. The fixed section remains unchanged. It is our goal to update the updatable section twice a year. The next update will take place in October 2014.
