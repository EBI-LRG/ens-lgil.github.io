title: LRGs in the UCSC Genome Browser
---

LRG regions and transcripts are now available to view in the UCSC Genome Browser. The “LRG Regions” track is in the “Mapping and Sequencing” group, while the “LRG Transcripts” track is in the “Genes and Gene Predictions” group. Searching using an LRG accession number is also supported and will return all LRG transcripts for that specific accession.
