title: 500 Public LRG Milestone Achieved
---

The LRG Project has now made over **500** LRGs public.  
These records have been created specifically for the reporting of variants at genes with clinical implications. They contain stable reference sequences as well as additional information that reflects the most up-to-date biological knowledge on these genes. The use of LRGs has been recommended by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS).  
We would like to express our appreciation to all our collaborators for their valuable contribution and for helping us achieve this important milestone.  We continue to  work on finalizing an additional 200 pending records and welcome additional requests. All LRGs can be viewed at [www.lrg-sequence.org](http://www.lrg-sequence.org).
