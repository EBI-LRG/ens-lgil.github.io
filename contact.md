<h3 class="icon-request margin-top-30" id="request-a-lrg">Request an LRG</h3>

If no LRG record exists for your gene of interest, you can [request](/lrg-request) one to be created for you.    

<h3 class="icon-submit margin-top-40" id="submit-variants">Submit variants to obtain accession numbers</h3>

Consistent with the goals of the LRG collaboration, we offer the opportunity to [submit](/documentation/submit-variants) information about variants to [dbSNP]({{ site.urls.ncbi }}/projects/SNP/) or [dbVar]({{ site.urls.ncbi }}/dbvar)/[DGVa]({{ site.urls.embl_ebi }}/dgva/), as appropriate, and obtain an accession number for each variant. The results will be returned to you as outlined in this document.  
Contact us with any pre-submission queries or send your submission directly to the email address above.    

<h3 class="icon-support margin-top-40" id="help-and-feedback">Help and feedback</h3>

We welcome feedback on the LRG project. If you need help and support on technical issues concerning LRGs please don't hesitate to contact us.
