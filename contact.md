### Request a LRG

If no LRG record exists for your gene of interest, you can [request](/lrg-request) one to be created for you.  
<span class="icon-next-page close-icon-2">Send your request to <a href="mailto:request@lrg-sequence.org">request@lrg-sequence.org</a>.</span>  
<br />


### Submit variants to obtain accession numbers

Consistent with the goals of the LRG collaboration, we offer the opportunity to [submit](/submit-variants) information about variants to [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/) or [dbVar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar)/[DGVa](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/), as appropriate, and obtain an accession number for each variant. The results will be returned to you as outlined in this document.  
<span class="icon-next-page close-icon-2">Send your submission to <a href="mailto:submit-variants@lrg-sequence.org">submit-variants@lrg-sequence.org</a>.</span>
