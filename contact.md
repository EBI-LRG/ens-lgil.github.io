### Request a LRG

If no LRG record exists for your gene of interest, you can [request](/lrg-request) one to be created for you.  


### Submit variants to obtain accession numbers

Consistent with the goals of the LRG collaboration, we offer the opportunity to [submit](/submit-variants) information about variants to [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/) or [dbVar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar)/[DGVa](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/), as appropriate, and obtain an accession number for each variant. The results will be returned to you as outlined in this document.  
Contact us with any pre-submission queries or send your submission directly to the email address above.  


### Help and feedback

We welcome feedback on the LRG project.  If you need help and support on technical issues concerning LRGs please don't hesitate to contact us.
