### Request a LRG

If no LRG record exists for your gene of interest, you can [request](/lrg-request) one to be created for you. Send your request to **request@lrg-sequence.org**.


### Submit variants to obtain accession numbers

Consistent with the goals of the LRG collaboration, we offer the opportunity to [submit](/submit-variants") information about variants to [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/) or [dbVar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar)/[DGVa](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/), as appropriate, and obtain an accession number for each variant. The results will be returned to you as outlined in this document.  
Send your submission to **submit-variants@lrg-sequence.org**.


### Help and feedback

For help and support on the technical issues concerning LRGs (e.g. the XML schema) and the LRG website, please send an email to **help@lrg-sequence.org**.  
For feedback on the LRG specification, website etc., please send an email to **feedback@lrg-sequence.org**.
